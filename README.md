# Student-Smart-Contract
A simple Ethereum smart contract to manage student records. You can add, update, and retrieve student details like ID, name, age, and department. The contract ensures only valid students can be accessed or updated.  Built and tested using Remix IDE, this project demonstrates basic blockchain data storage and smart contract functionality.
